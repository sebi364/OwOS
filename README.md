# OwOS
How to (not) design an OS 101
## About:
OwOS is a small project that I'm working on, with the goal of learning a bit more about how computers work, and how to program in lower level languages. It doesn't serve any practical purpose, It's just something that I do for fun.

## Current State:
The OS consists of a bootloader and a kernel that can write text, and draw pixels to the screen:

## Credit:
This project is heavily based on [nanobyte's excelent guide on building an OS](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLFjM7v6KGMpiH2G-kT781ByCNC_0pKpPN), with some additions that I made myself.
